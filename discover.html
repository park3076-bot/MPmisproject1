          <h3>Outdoor Connection</h3>
          <p class="muted" style="line-height: 1.8; font-size: 1.1rem;">
            My deep connection with outdoor sports isn't just personal—it's professional fuel. Whether I'm snowboarding fresh powder, playing lacrosse, or exploring the North Shore, these experiences give me authentic insight into what motivates active communities. I understand the mindset of people who choose to push their limits, embrace challenge, and find joy in the journey as much as the destination.
          </p>
          <p class="muted" style="line-height: 1.8; font-size: 1.1rem; margin-top: 16px;">
            This lived experience allows me to create marketing that feels natural and exciting rather than forced or commercial. When I develop campaigns for outdoor or action sports brands, I'm not just analyzing market segments—I'm speaking to people who share my values and lifestyle. This authenticity resonates and creates genuine connection between brands and communities.

          <h3>Personal Notes</h3>
          <div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: auto 1fr; gap: 24px; align-items: start;">
            <img src="media/prof1.jpg" alt="Max Parker portrait" class="portrait" style="width: 200px; height: 200px; object-fit: cover; border-radius: 12px;">
            <div>
              <p class="muted" style="line-height: 1.8; font-size: 1.1rem;">
                I prioritize clarity in communication because I believe great ideas need great storytelling to make impact. Accountability in execution ensures that strategies become reality, not just documents. Continuous learning keeps me adaptable in an ever-evolving landscape.
              </p>
              <p class="muted" style="line-height: 1.8; font-size: 1.1rem; margin-top: 16px;">
                Outside work and sport, I find inspiration in photography—capturing the intersection of human experience and natural beauty. Travel opens my perspective to different cultures and marketing approaches. Music, particularly the energy of live performances, reminds me that the best experiences engage all the senses and create lasting emotional connection.

          <h3>Looking Forward</h3>
          <p class="muted" style="line-height: 1.8; font-size: 1.1rem;">
            I'm excited about the future of marketing, particularly how technology and authenticity will continue to intersect. I want to be part of campaigns that not only achieve business objectives but also contribute positively to the communities they engage. Whether through environmental initiatives, youth sports support, or simply creating spaces where people can connect over shared passions, I believe marketing can be a force for good.
          </p>
          <p class="muted" style="line-height: 1.8; font-size: 1.1rem; margin-top: 16px;">
            My ultimate goal is to lead marketing that feels as good to create as it does to experience—campaigns that people remember not because they were sold to, but because they felt understood, inspired, and invited to be part of something bigger than themselves.
